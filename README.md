# Welcome to WebRTC-W5CAPI

My Name is Murugan Pandian. I started my career as a WebRTC developer 3 years ago. I love and live this technology since then. 

## So, What is WebRTC?
Web Real-time communication is a technology that enables real-time commuication via browsers. More than one billion devices, including tablets, smartphones and PCs, already support WebRTC, and that number is expected to increase to over six billion or more by 2019. In adddition to enabling real-time communication via browsers, it is also possible to enable commuincation using WebRTC technology in Mobile Applications (IOS and Android),Desktop Applications (Unix, Mac and Windows), Machine to Machine / Internet of Things Applications (Camera, Smart home), Interconnecting with PSTN or 2G/3G/4G Mobile phones and more.

## What is WebRTC-W5CAPI?
First, My sincere thanks to W5RTC, a real-time software solution provider (https://w5rtc.com/).co.in/), for supporting my passion to launch WebRTC-W5CAPI open source.

Historically, attempts to build real-time solution depended on expensive special hardware and custom-built software, placing tremendous demand on infrastructure that is affordable only by big and incumber equipment providers and service providers.Thanks to WebRTC, it has become possible to deliver real-time comunication solutions easily and less expensively. Ofcourse there are challenges but solvable. My vision is to do it through WebRTC-W5CAPI.   

WebRTC-W5CAPI is a Opensource Platform as a Service (PaaS) Application Programmable Interface (API) for building Wireless-Wireline-World-Wide-Web Software as a Service (SaaS) products for any verticals such as healthcare and education.

## Why W5CAPI Opensource? 

W5CAPI is different because the it has all for you to build your own platform and applications without reling on any commercial 3rd party providers. It includes:

1. Scalable Client API (CDN Server) and Signaling Server code
2. How to Build your own platform (NAT, Freeswitch...)
3. Demo for building web applications
4. CDR for your Billing 
5. Voice, Video, Chat, File sharing and Screen Sharing 
6. Interworking with PSTN/Mobile Phones

I, friends, contributers, sponsors and partner companies are committed to continue developing roadmap to support Multi-User communication using MCU, Mobile SDK and more in future.

Welcome to WebRTC-W5CAPI ! We am looking forward to engage and share our passion of making communication possible to all. Webrtc Rocks! Rocks! Rocks!
